# Quick workflow


## Importing data

Let's get started with importing our raw data into R. 

The easiest way is to use the `import_files()` function. Its purpose is to read any kind of raw data and store it in the `.imports` list. If no argument is supplied for `files`, the function opens a separate window to manually specify the file/s.




## Organize datasets

Once all raw files are loaded, we need to extract and organize the useful data into the `.datasets` list. Each list entry contains one dataset from one imported raw file. 

```
new_dataset(import = .imports[["Hjv_proteomics_DEN_proteinGroups"]],
            name = "DEN",
            identifier = "Protein.IDs" ,
            data.types = c("Gene.names",
                           "Protein.names",
                           "LFQ.intensity",
                           "Only.identified.by.site",
                           "Potential.contaminant",
                           "Reverse"))
```
