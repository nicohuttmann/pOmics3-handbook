# Preface {-}

Welcome! This handbook is a reference guide to use the pOmics3 R package for proteomics data analysis. Yes, it's the third version of an old idea - alle guten Dinge sind 3!

For reasons, I decided to rethink the way I analyze data at the beginning of my PhD. It's basically a collection of ideas, workflows and ideas for myself, which I look up every other time I start a new analysis.


Main features:

-   Framework to load, handle and analyze proteomics data
-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) friendly
-   Statistical analysis of qualitative and quantitative data
-   Functional enrichment analysis via [fgsea](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fgsea.html)
-   [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), for publication-quality figures
-   [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/), for interactive data exploration
