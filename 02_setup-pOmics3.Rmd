# Setup pOmics3

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

Prior to installing the `pOmics3` package, it helps to install required packages separately. This sometimes makes your life easier. 

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")

install.packages(c("vroom"))






```


Other functions not required for the `pOmics3` package but covered in this book can be installed with the following command.


```{r}
# Chapter 4
install.packages(c("ggvenn"))


install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("ComplexHeatmap")
install.packages("magick")

# Chapter 5
install.packages(c(""))
```
